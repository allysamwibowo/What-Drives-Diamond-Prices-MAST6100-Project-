# What-Drives-Diamond-Prices-MAST6100-Project-
This project analyses diamond pricing by classifying diamonds into high-priced and non-high-priced groups using size and quality characteristics. Exploratory data analysis and multiple classification models are applied, showing that carat and the 4Cs dominate pricing and that classical statistical models perform best.
