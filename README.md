This project explores how diamond characteristics influence pricing by classifying diamonds into high-priced and non-high-priced categories. Using a structured dataset containing both numerical and categorical variables related to diamond size and quality, the analysis applies Exploratory Data Analysis to identify key patterns and relationships within the data. Several classification models are implemented and compared, including Logistic Regression, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbours, and a Neural Network. Model performance is evaluated using a train–test split to assess generalisation ability. The results show that diamond size and quality attributes, particularly carat and the “4Cs”, play a dominant role in price classification, and that classical statistical models outperform more complex approaches for this structured dataset. This project highlights the value of interpretable classification methods for real-world pricing and valuation applications in the diamond industry.
